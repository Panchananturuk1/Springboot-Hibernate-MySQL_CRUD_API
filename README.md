The domain model consists of a single entity, User. The data access layer uses Hibernate to persist User objects to a MySQL database. The RESTful API exposes a set of endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD operations on User objects.

The project is configured to use an embedded MySQL database. This means that you do not need to have a MySQL server running in order to run the project. The embedded database will be created automatically when the project is started.

To run the project, you can use the following command:

mvn spring-boot:run
Once the project is running, you can access the RESTful API using a REST client such as Postman. The following are the endpoints that are available:

GET /users: This endpoint returns a list of all users.
GET /users/{id}: This endpoint returns a single user by ID.
POST /users: This endpoint creates a new user.
PUT /users/{id}: This endpoint updates an existing user.
DELETE /users/{id}: This endpoint deletes a user by ID.
