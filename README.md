The domain model consists of a single entity, User. The data access layer uses Hibernate to persist User objects to a MySQL database. The RESTful API exposes a set of endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD operations on User objects.

The project is configured to use an embedded MySQL database. This means that you do not need to have a MySQL server running in order to run the project. The embedded database will be created automatically when the project is started.

Spring Boot is a framework that makes it easy to create REST APIs. It provides a number of features that make it easy to develop, test, and deploy REST APIs, such as:

Autoconfiguration: Spring Boot automatically configures many of the components needed to create a REST API, such as a servlet container and a database connection.
Starter dependencies: Spring Boot provides starter dependencies for popular frameworks and libraries, such as JPA and Hibernate. This makes it easy to add these frameworks to your project without having to manually configure them.
Convention over configuration: Spring Boot follows the convention over configuration principle, which means that it makes assumptions about how your project should be structured. This can make it easier to develop REST APIs, but it can also make it more difficult to customize the behavior of your application.
Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that allows you to map Java objects to database tables. This makes it easier to interact with data in a database from your REST APIs.

To create a REST API with Spring Boot and Hibernate, you can follow these steps:

Create a Spring Boot project.
Add the JPA and Hibernate dependencies to your project.
Create a database and a table to store your data.
Create a Java class to represent each row in your table.
Create a JPA repository to interact with the database.
Create a REST controller to expose the data from your repository.
